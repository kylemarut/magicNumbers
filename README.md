# magicNumbers
c++ code. Performs calculations checking to see if any numbers fail the famous Collatz Conjecture math problem. If a number is even, divide by two. If it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Any number following these rules houlde eventually lead back to 1.

Used things like threading and adding a database for all known numbers to go through a large amount of numbers more quickly.
